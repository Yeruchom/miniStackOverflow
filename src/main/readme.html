<p>the form with questions is created dynamically and gets written to user
</p>
<p>the parameter 'questionNum' is added to the url that is sent to AnswerServlet so we know witch question he is answering.
</p>
<p>the AnswerServlet puts the 'questionNum' as a input type=hidden, and so the AddAnswerServlet that adds the answer to the db knows
    witch question it is.
</p>

<p>note! the 'doPost' function was implement onky by the AddAnswerServlet. all other servlets do not need to implement the post
methods since no one is posting to them</p>
